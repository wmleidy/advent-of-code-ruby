# Advent of Code - Ruby Solutions

This repository houses my lightly refactored solutions to the festive problems over at [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). All solutions are written in Ruby and are "lightly refactored" because:

- A few of the initial submissions were written as quickly as possible in order to compete for the daily leaderboard
- Multiple rounds of refactoring would be a disproportionate investment of time

In some cases below my solutions I have included outlines of alternative (read: better and/or more Ruby-like) approaches to solving these problems, which were gathered from the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
